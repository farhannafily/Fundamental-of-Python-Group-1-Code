# Fundamental-of-Python-Group-1-Code

In this portfolio, we will explain the basics and fundamental of python including operation, conditional, and repetition.

**Type Casting**

Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users. Python has two types of Type Casting; Implicit Type Casting and Explicit Type Casting

**Implicit Type Casting**
In Implicit type casting, Python automatically converts one data type to another data type. This process doesn't need any user involvement.
**Explicit Type Casting**
In Explicit Type Casting, Python need user involvement to convert the variable data type into certain data type in order to the operation required.

**Input and Output**

Python provides numerous built-in functions that are readily available to us at the Python prompt. Some of the functions like input() and print() are widely used for standard input and output operations respectively.

**Dynamic Typing**

Types in Python are determined during run-time as opposed to compile-time and thus programmers are not required to declare variables before using them in the code.

Technically, a variable is created when it's assigned a value for the first time in the code. This means that a variable must first be assigned a value before it is referenced in the code otherwise an error will be reported. And as mentioned earlier, the variable assignment never comes with a type definition since the type is stored with objects and not with variables/names. Every time a variable is identified, it automatically gets replaced with the object in memory it references.

**Transformation**

**lower**
In Python, lower() is a built-in method used for string handling. The lower() methods returns the lowercased string from the given string. It converts all uppercase characters to lowercase. If no uppercase characters exist, it returns the original string.

**upper**
In Python, upper() is a built-in method used for string handling. The upper() methods returns the uppercased string from the given string. It converts all lowercase characters to uppercase. If no lowercase characters exist, it returns the original string.

**rstrip**
Python String rstrip() method returns a copy of the string with trailing characters removed (based on the string argument passed). If no argument is passed, it removes trailing spaces.

**lstrip**
Python String lstrip() method returns a copy of the string with leading characters removed (based on the string argument passed). If no argument is passed, it removes leading spaces.

**strip**
strip() is an inbuilt function in Python programming language that returns a copy of the string with both leading and trailing characters removed (based on the string argument passed).

**Startswith**
The startswith () method returns True if the string starts with the specified value, otherwise False.

**Endswith**
The endswith() method returns True if the string ends with the specified value, otherwise False.

**Change The String Element**

**Replace()**
The replace() method replaces a specified phrase with another specified phrase.

**Check The String**

**Isupper**
The isupper() method returns True if all the characters are in upper case, otherwise False.

**Islower**
The islower() method returns True if all the characters are in lower case, otherwise False.

**Chain of Method**
We can do operation to other operation results

**Isalpha**
The isalpha() method returns True if all the characters are alphabet letters (a-z).

**Isalnum**
The isalnum() method returns True if all the characters are alphanumeric, meaning alphabet letter (a-z) and numbers (0-9).

**Isdecimal**
The isdecimal() method returns True if all the characters are decimals (0-9).

**Isspace**
The isspace() method returns True if all the characters in a string are whitespaces, otherwise False.

**Istitle**
The istitle() method returns True if all words in a text start with a upper case letter, AND the rest of the word are lower case letters, otherwise False.

**Formatting The String**

**zfill**
The zfill() method adds zeros (0) at the beginning of the string, until it reaches the specified length.

**Operation List, Set, dan String**

**len()**
calculate the length or number of elements of a List

**min() and max()**
The smallest number and the largest number

**Range**
range function can have 1-3 parameters. range with 1 parameter n: create a series of numbers starting from 0, as many as n numbers

**in and not in**
operators in and not in: to find out a value or object is in the list

**Assign values ​​to multiple variables**
has multiple variables and needs to assign values ​​to those variables.

**Sort()**
sort numbers or order of letters
can use list

**Assign Values to Multiple Variables**
Mark the variables with the desired value, one by one

**Operator, Operands, and Expressions**
Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.
